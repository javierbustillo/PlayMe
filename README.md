Build custom Spotify playlists based on your liked songs

Are you tired of building your different playlists by hand? Then look no further! This script takes any search term, trains a model, and then creates a playlists of your liked
songs that fit with that term.

For example:

Search for "Beach" music
It goes into Spotify and scrapes the top 20 playlists with "Beach" in the title. 

With those 20 playlists it then trains a model to recognize "Beach" music.

Then it goes into your liked songs and filters out any song that is not "Beach"-like.


Bam a playlist is created with your curated beach music
